# Connect-four-FPGA Game
This Connect Four game system, developed using Verilog, is designed to deliver an intuitive and interactive gaming experience on an FPGA board. Players use physical switches to select columns for token placement, while an LED matrix displays the current state of the game board. The interface also features 7-segment displays to indicate the current player and the winner, enhancing user engagement. This system effectively demonstrates key digital design concepts such as finite state machines (FSM), synchronization techniques, and edge detection. By leveraging the FPGA's ability to handle multiple parallel processes, the game ensures responsive gameplay and accurate real-time feedback.
